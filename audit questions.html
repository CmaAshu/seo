                question: "Write short notes on the responsibility of a joint auditor.",
                answer: `<h4>SA 299: Responsibility of Joint Auditor</h4>
                <p>SA 299, Responsibility of Joint Auditor, has prescribed the following guidelines with respect to joint audit:</p>
                <p><strong>A. Division of Work:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a) Where joint auditors are appointed, they should, by mutual discussion, divide the audit work among themselves. The division of work would usually be in terms of audit of identifiable units or specified areas.</li>
                    <li>b) In such situations, the division of work may be with reference to items of assets or liabilities or income or expenditure or with reference to periods of time.</li>
                    <li>c) Certain areas of work, owing to their importance or owing to the nature of the work involved, would often not be divided and would be covered by all the joint auditors.</li>
                    <li>d) The division of work among joint auditors as well as the areas of work to be covered by all of them should be adequately documented and preferably communicated to the entity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>B. Co-ordination:</strong></p>
                <p>Where, in the course of his work, a joint auditor comes across matters which are relevant to the areas of responsibility of other joint auditors and which deserve their attention, or which require disclosure or require discussion with, or application of judgement by, other joint auditors, he should communicate the same to all the other joint auditors in writing. This should be done by the submission of a report or note prior to the finalisation of the audit.</p>
                <p><strong>C. Relationship among Joint Auditors and Their Responsibility:</strong></p>
                <p>In respect of audit work divided among the joint auditors, each joint auditor is responsible only for the work allocated to him, whether or not he has prepared a separate report on the work performed by him. On the other hand, all the joint auditors are jointly and severally responsible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(a) in respect of the audit work which is not divided among the joint auditors and is carried out by all of them;</li>
                    <li>(b) in respect of decisions taken by all the joint auditors concerning the nature, timing or extent of the audit procedures to be performed by any of the joint auditors.</li>
                    <li>(c) in respect of matters which are brought to the notice of the joint auditors by any one of them and on which there is an agreement among the joint auditors;</li>
                    <li>(d) for examining that the financial statements of the entity comply with the disclosure requirements of the relevant statute; and</li>
                    <li>(e) for ensuring that the audit report complies with the requirements of the relevant statute.</li>
