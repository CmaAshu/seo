        answer: `
            <p class="text-lg font-black text-slate-700 mb-4 border-b pb-2">SA 299, Responsibility of Joint Auditor, has prescribed the following guidelines with respect to joint audit:</p>

            <h3 class="text-cyan-700 font-extrabold mb-2 uppercase text-sm tracking-widest">📐 Division of Work:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 italic">Where joint auditors are appointed, they should, by mutual discussion, <strong>divide the audit work among themselves</strong>. The division of work would usually be in terms of audit of identifiable units or specified areas. In some cases, due to the nature of the business of the entity under audit, such a division of work may not be possible. In such situations, the division of work may be with reference to items of assets or liabilities or income or expenditure or with reference to periods of time. Certain areas of work, owing to their importance or owing to the nature of the work involved, would often not be divided and would be covered by all the joint auditors. The division of work among joint auditors as well as the areas of work to be covered by all of them should be <strong>adequately documented and preferably communicated to the entity</strong>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-cyan-700 font-extrabold mb-2 uppercase text-sm tracking-widest">🤝 Co-ordination:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 italic">Where, in the course of his work, a joint auditor comes across matters which are relevant to the areas of responsibility of other joint auditors and which deserve their attention, or which require disclosure or require discussion with, or application of judgement by, other joint auditors, <strong>he should communicate the same to all the other joint auditors in writing</strong>. This should be done by the submission of a report or note prior to the finalisation of the audit.</p>

            <h3 class="text-cyan-700 font-extrabold mb-2 uppercase text-sm tracking-widest">⚖️ Relationship among Joint Auditors and Their Responsibility:</h3>
            <p class="mb-3 italic font-medium">In respect of audit work divided among the joint auditors, each joint auditor is responsible only for the work allocated to him, whether or not he has prepared a separate report on the work performed by him. On the other hand, all the joint auditors are <strong>jointly and severally responsible</strong>:</p>
            <ul class="mb-6 space-y-4">
                <li class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-cyan-300 italic">🔸 in respect of the audit work which is <strong>not divided</strong> among the joint auditors and is carried out by all of them;</li>
                <li class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-cyan-300 italic">🔸 in respect of <strong>decisions taken by all the joint auditors</strong> concerning the nature, timing or extent of the audit procedures to be performed by any of the joint auditors. It may, however, be clarified that all the joint auditors are responsible only in respect of the appropriateness of the decisions concerning the nature, timing or extent of the audit procedures agreed upon among them; proper execution of these audit procedures is the separate and specific responsibility of the joint auditor concerned;</li>
                <li class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-cyan-300 italic">🔸 in respect of matters which are brought to the notice of the joint auditors by any one of them and on which there is an <strong>agreement among the joint auditors</strong>;</li>
                <li class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-cyan-300 italic">🔸 for examining that the <strong>financial statements of the entity comply with the disclosure requirements</strong> of the relevant statute; and</li>
                <li class="pl-4 border-l-2 border-cyan-300 italic">🔸 for ensuring that the <strong>audit report complies with the requirements</strong> of the relevant statute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-3 bg-slate-100 rounded-xl font-medium italic text-slate-500 text-xs">If any matters of the nature referred to in (B) above are brought to the attention of the entity or other joint auditors by an auditor after the audit report has been submitted, the other joint auditors would not be responsible for those matters.</p>

            <h4 class="text-indigo-700 font-black mt-4 mb-1">🔗 Dependence on Other Auditors:</h4>
            <p class="mb-4 italic text-sm">Each joint auditor is entitled to assume that the other joint auditors have carried out their part of the audit work in accordance with the generally accepted audit procedures. It is not necessary for a joint auditor to review the work performed by other joint auditors or perform any tests in order to ascertain whether the work has actually been performed in such a manner. Each joint auditor is entitled to rely upon the other joint auditors for bringing to his notice any departure from generally accepted accounting principles or any material error noticed in the course of the audit.</p>

            <h4 class="text-indigo-700 font-black mb-1">📢 Reporting Responsibilities:</h4>
            <p class="text-sm">Normally, the joint auditors are able to arrive at an agreed report. However, where the joint auditors are in <strong>disagreement</strong> with regard to any matters to be covered by the report, each one of them should express his own opinion through a <strong>separate report</strong>. A joint auditor is not bound by the views of the majority of the joint auditors regarding matters to be covered in the report and should express his opinion in a separate report in case of a disagreement.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 italic text-sm">As per sub-rule (4) of Rule 6 of the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules 2014 as amended, a Cost Auditor is required to submit the <strong>Cost Audit Report</strong> along with his or its reservations or qualifications or observations or suggestions, if any, in <strong>form CRA-3</strong> to Board of Directors of the company within a period of <strong>one hundred and eighty days from the closure of the financial year</strong> to which the report relates.</p>

            <p class="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">Section 148 also provides that qualifications, disqualifications, rights, duties and obligations applicable to auditors (financial) shall apply to a cost auditor appointed under this section. The eligibility, qualifications and disqualifications are provided in Section 141 of the Act and powers and duties are provided in Section 143.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 italic text-sm text-slate-600">Section 143(14) specifically states that the provisions of Section 143 shall <strong>mutatis mutandis</strong> apply to a cost auditor appointed under Section 148. There are no other provisions governing the appointment of a cost auditor.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-sm font-medium">Section 139(3) of the Act, applicable to appointment of auditors (financial), and Rule 6 of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 deals with the provision of rotation of auditors and these provisions are applicable <strong>only to appointment of auditors (financial)</strong>. The Act <strong>does not provide for rotation in case of appointment of cost auditors</strong> and the same is not applicable to a cost auditor. It may, however, be noted that though there is no statutory provision for rotation of cost auditors, individual companies may do so as a part of their policy, as is the practice with Public Sector Undertakings.</p>

He may or may not get correct or complete information. As such, if such explanation and information prove to be untrue, then the audit report is affected adversely as well.</span></li>

                <li class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 bg-amber-50 rounded-3xl border border-amber-100">🛑 <span><strong>Inherent Limitations of the Financial Statements:</strong> Limitations of audit mainly stem from limitations of financial statements. It is true that financial statements may not disclose the true picture even after audit due to inflationary trends. Further, certain non-monetary facts cannot be measured.</span></li>
                
                <li class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 bg-amber-50 rounded-3xl border border-amber-100">🛑 <span><strong>No Assurance:</strong> There is no assurance on the part of the auditor about future profitability and prospects of the organization.</span></li>

            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed italic font-medium p-6 bg-pink-50 rounded-3xl border border-pink-100 shadow-inner text-slate-700">Unlike a statutory audit, in a non-statutory audit the objective and scope of an audit is not clearly described in any law. Accordingly, a misunderstanding may arise about the exact scope of the work. Thus to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or dispute it is in the interests of both the auditor as well as the client to exactly define the scope of the engagement. An auditor's engagement letter signifies the confirmation by the auditor of his acceptance of appointment as auditor, the documentation of the objective and scope of audit or other work, and the extent of his responsibilities to the client and the form of any reports.</p>
